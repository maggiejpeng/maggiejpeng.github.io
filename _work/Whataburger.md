# Whataburger goes on TikTok
*Spec work*  
my role: strategist, copy 

__Background__
While Whataburger is doing well amid COVID and has a history of avid fans, young people who didn't grow up with the brand do not feel the same affinity towards Whataburger.

__Challenge__
Develop a TikTok campaign to drive brand awareness and consideration for Whataburger as TikTok has become a popular platform shaping the culture among 18-24 year olds. Advertising on TikTok is relatively new and best practices are still being discovered. How should Whataburger show up on TikTok in a relevant, authentic, engaging way?

__Advantage__
Whataburger's burgers are customizable and made-to-order, fresh 24/7.

### You’ve got the Whopper, the Big Mac, the Double-Double... but none of them are <u>your</u> burger.  

__Insight__
Being able to create and customize their own experience gives people a sense of ownership over their choice.

## People are happier when they can create their own satisfaction.

__Evidence__
Gen Z wants to be perceived as unique and is all about celebrating individuality and expressing their own identity.

## It’s not your burger unless it has everything <u> you</u> want in it.

__Solution__
Whataburger will help everyone express and celebrate their personality by allowing them to craft their own mouth watering whataburgers on TikTok through the hashtag, #MyWhataburger.

## Nobody eats the same thing, and at Whataburger, nobody has to.
