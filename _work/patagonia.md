# Patagonia makes workwear?
_Spec work_  
my role: strategist, media planner  
tools: simmons, commspoint, desktop research


__Objective__  
Patagonia wants to connect with working audiences that aren’t all existing Patagonia customers.

__Problem__  
Despite a strong and successful sporting and outdoors apparel line, Patagonia faces the challenge of anonymity in the workwear market. As a new player in an established game, the workwear line needs to appeal to a new audience who knows little to nothing about the brand while differentiating itself from household names like Dickies and Carhartt.

__Barriers__  
“I don’t feel the line is worth paying a premium for."  
“I don’t know what Patagonia is or that they sell workwear.”

__Findings on Pastoral Pride segment__  
They work in building maintenance, construction, farming, forestry, fishing, and they work *a lot*.
Their family depend on their work for financial security.
36% attended trade schools and trained for years for their job.
Their hobbies at home are closely aligned with things they do at work.

For 
The Everyday Warriors, 
workwear isn’t just clothing for work, it’s clothing for life.

Because of their busy schedule and also due to their unique passions for their occupations, they don’t seem to separate between work and home. They wear what is most convenient and most versatile. Patagonia needs to be something they let not just into their work day, but a brand they invite into theirr homes and all aspects of their lives.

__Strategy__  
We can sell more workwear to *Everyday Warriors* by not positioning it as just workwear. 
Patagonia’s workwear has the most cutting edge technology, making it versatile for home and work —— Jeans that are guaranteed for life, take no time to break in, and are also 15 times stronger than steel is more than perfect for the work site. And those same jeans can be worn for relaxing.

By reaching our target in many different areas of their life through different media such as radio, TV and Facebook, we want our messaging to mirror the versatility of the product. 
Awareness is our biggest barrier, but also has the potential to be our biggest strength.

__Positioning__  
Patagonia's workwear is the most comfortable, durable and versatile work clothes on the market, because what our consumers want is something they can wear, at work, at home and for life.

Sitting on the couch or in bed watching TV is where you will find over a third of the target audience for 20+ hours every week. They are traditional users of cable television and 95.3% of Everyday Warriors have watched TV in the past 7 days. They watch television undisrupted and don’t look at their phones or engage in other electronic activities. 
Patagonia will sponsor The Weather Channel show, That’s Amazing, which features “pioneers of the great outdoors who challenge nature, seek out its limits, reveal its secrets and embrace its awesome power.” A perfect fit for the Patagonia brand, the original series tells a story relating to the Everyday Warrior’s interests in fishing, nature, and weather. 


Dirty Jobs was a TV series on the Discovery Channel in which host Mike Rowe is shown performing difficult, strange, disgusting, or messy occupational duties alongside the typical employees.

We will  run personalized video ads specifically targeting the Everyday Warriors by showing Mike wearing Patagonia Workwear and talking about all things work related. All advertisements will lead users directly to Patagonia’s website to have a chance to enter a contest to win a day with Mike Rowe. To further engage our audience, and keep those that did not win the contest involved, Facebook will be livestreaming the meet up between Mike and the winner and allow viewers to tune in and feel like they too are spending the day with Mike. Mike will follow the winner from work to home, showing the durability of the clothes with a wear-test through tough tasks, and the comfort of the same work clothes at home after work by wearing pieces from the Workwear collection at dinner later the same day. There will be an hour period during the day for viewers to have the opportunity to comment questions under the livestream and Mike will answer the functionalities of the Patagonia work clothes directly, sharing how it feels to be in them.
