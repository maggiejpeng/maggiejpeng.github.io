# About Maggie

I was the kid who annoyed everyone with questions of why and in many ways, Iâ€™m still that kid. Today, I love doing what Malcom Gladwell calls, "connecting the dots," solving problems by asking good questions that clarify reality and identify common threads in situations and cultural phenomenon, and in people and problems. 

Born in Sichuan (yes the word synonymous with spicy on Chinese menu), bred in Shanghai, I spent my formative years of high school in Connecticut daydreaming a lot, debating ideas to and fro classes and enjoying a kind of never-been-tasted freedom that has molded me into a malleable, adaptable and unapologetic wonderer. As a cosmopolitan, the diversity of my experience has pushed me to always try harder to understand the other side. Throught that I have a nuanced curiosity for people and culture, and the same goes when I conduct research as a strategist or go about solving business/human problems when they're not readily relatable.

*I am an aspiring strategist who thinks like a problem-solver and delivers as a storyteller. Beyond asking why and resisting groupthink all the time, I love being challenged, creating genuine connections and making a difference wherever I go. Currently I fulfill those passions by being a member of the advisory board for We Are Next, a co-founder at Indoor Recess (a virtual student advertising competition created this summer in lieu of hiring freezes) where I secured Color of Change and Twitch as clients, and former EIC and now president of Globalists, a student publication that starts in-depth conversations about culture, identity and global issues.*


  * i work hard
  * i'm always working on being a better human
  * i like controversial ideas
